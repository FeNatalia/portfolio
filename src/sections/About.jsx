            Hello! Iâ€™m Natalia, a Full Stack Developer based in Stockholm. Welcome to my website, here you can find
            information about projects that I have developed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in Full Stack development with a user-centric design on mind. Additionally, 
            I have previous experience working with Project Management at a Swedish EdTech startup. 
            And I have accomplished training which prepared me to work as a Scrum Master.
